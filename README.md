# Advanced Software Design (IIT Sri Lanka) CW 2

The expense tracking and budgeting application is designed and developed with following features:
1. Allow a user to see a list of recent transactions
2. Allow a user to enter a new transaction. At a minimum, this should include amount,whether it is an income or expense transaction and which category it falls under. Amore advanced application will allow the user to enter a note and to specify whetherit is recurring)
3. Allow the user to edit/delete transactions
4. Allow the user to see a list of categories. The application should come with somepreset categories. An advanced application will allow the user to add newcategories.
5. Allow the user to enter a budget, specifying amounts for each category.
6. Allow the user to track their progress against their budget by seeing how much theyhave spent in each category against the budget for that category, as well as overallspending against overall budget.


The user interface and menu should be console-based and use a simple character-basedmenu system
